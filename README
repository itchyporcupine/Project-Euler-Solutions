My humble set of solutions to selected project euler problems. If you do not know what project euler is, check out projecteuler.net.

There are two helpful scripts included: util.py and problems/solutions.py


util.py

The usage for util.py is simple:

    util.py gen filename.py 43

This command creates a file "filename.py" and copies the description of the 43rd problem into a docstring in filename.py.

problems/solutions.py

problems/solutions.py is a driver script for each one of the solutions. Usage:

solutions.py n

Will run the solution to the nth problem.
